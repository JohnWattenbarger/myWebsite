					<h2> About Me </h2>
					<hr />
					<p>
						Hi I'm John Wattenbarger, a software developer currently working at NASA to develop new software
						for the Orion spacecraft as part of the Artemis mission.
						I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from the <a
							href="http://www.stthom.edu">University of St. Thomas Houston</a>. While in college, I
						founded the Computer Science Club to help teach students more about programming, and to team up
						with other Computer Science students. I served as president of the
						Computer Science Club for 2 years, where I collaborated with officers and other school clubs to
						host multiple fun and informative events. After graduating in
						December of 2018, I began working as a software developer at NASA.
					</p>
					<p>
						While at NASA, I have worked to develop 3 new applications frequently switching between frontend
						and backend programming. I pride myself on being a flexible developer that is able to pick up
						new languages and frameworks quickly while maintaining quality, maintainable code. I created
						this website while in college to teach myself the basics of web development.
						This website contains some information about me, and show off some
						simple JavaScript games I created to improve my coding skills.

					<h3><a href="formatting_practice.html"> Resum&eacute </a></h3>
					<hr />
					<p> This is one of the first webpages that I created. I experimented with different formatting
						techniques.
						Using CSS, I was able to recreate my resum&eacute in the form of a webpage.

					<h3><a href="Game_practice.html"> Games </a></h3>
					<hr />
					<p> I created this webpage to hold different javaScript games that I have made. The Flappy Bird game
						was originally created for a Computer Science Club event where I taught students how to make a
						video game from scratch.
